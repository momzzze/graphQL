# graphQL
This will be place to put my code and builds while learning graphql


Give us flexibility to query for data in a more efficient way.


- Rest API end points:
    Get all movies
    domain.com/movies

    Get a single movie:
    domain.com/movies/:id

    Get all directors:
    domain.com/directors

    Get a single director:
    domain.com/directors/:id

When we need it?
 when we need to jump in different points on the graph we can get the data and send it back as part of the quest.
